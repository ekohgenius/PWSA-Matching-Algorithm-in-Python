# PWSA-Matching-Algorithm-in-Python
This project was one carried out during a 2-week python programming workshop held in 2018 at the University of Ibadan and Organized by the PWSA (Programming Worshop for Scientists in Africa)

This project mirrors the selection process for Youth Corps Menmbers for the compulsory one-year National Youth Service in Nigeria

A file having 1000 entries by prospective corps members is provided where each entries has six choices of states within the country. A state is not meant to have more than 30 members allocated to it and each entry should be treated with preference according to the other in which the prospective corps members applied. 

The algorithm is about allocating each corps member to the most-preferred available state according to its entry.
